<h2>Types of Clouds</h2>
<p>There are four main types of clouds: cumulus, stratus, cirrus, and nimbus. Each type of cloud has its own unique characteristics and can be further classified into subcategories.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cumulus clouds:</strong> These clouds are fluffy and cotton-like, with flat bases and rounded tops. They are often associated with fair weather, but can grow into larger clouds that produce rain or snow.</li>
<li><strong>Stratus clouds:</strong> These clouds form a gray layer that covers the sky like a blanket. They are often associated with overcast weather and can produce drizzle or light snow.</li>
<li><strong>Cirrus clouds:</strong> These clouds are thin and wispy, and form high in the sky. They are made up of ice crystals and are often associated with fair weather.</li>
<li><strong>Nimbus clouds:</strong> These clouds are dark and gray, and are associated with precipitation. They can produce rain, snow, or other forms of precipitation.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Formation of Clouds</h2>
<p>Clouds form when warm, moist air rises into the atmosphere and cools. As the air cools, it can no longer hold all of its moisture, and the excess moisture condenses into tiny water droplets or ice crystals. These droplets or crystals form the clouds we see in the sky.</p>

<h2>Impact of Clouds</h2>
<p>Clouds play a crucial role in the Earth's climate and weather patterns. They reflect sunlight back into space, which helps to cool the Earth's surface. They also trap heat radiation from the Earth's surface, which helps to warm the atmosphere. Clouds can also produce precipitation, which can have a significant impact on agriculture, water resources, and other aspects of the environment.</p>
